# FluentUI Rich Text Editor (fluentui-rte)

This is a fork of [sstur/react-rte](https://github.com/sstur/react-rte), haphazardly (but beautifully) styled using [Microsoft's Fluent UI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui).

> :pencil2: **Developer Note**:
>
> I'm not using that word, _haphazardly_, lightly. This was hacked together for use in a client's project where a quick turnaroud time was necessary. Basically, I took the original component, and shoehorned-in all of Fluent's components. None of the tests were run, I didn't adhere to the code style — I didn't even read the documentation.

> The component works, if you want to use it, but I definitely need to do some cleanup here. If you get to it before I do, please open a pull request.

## Documentation

Please see the [original repo](https://github.com/sstur/react-rte) for documentation on this component.

## Screenshot

Here's the editor in-use as an e-mail composer (also paired with FluentUI components):
